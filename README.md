## Technologies Used

- **Compose Navigation:** A library for navigating between composable screens within your Android app üó∫Ô∏è.

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app is structured following the Model-View-ViewModel pattern to separate concerns and maintain code modularity. The implementation is customized to suit the project‚Äôs needs.
- **MediaPlayer**: Android‚Äôs native `MediaPlayer` API is used for audio playback.
- **MediaSessionCompat**: Integrated to manage media controls and handle interactions with other system media components.
- **Background, Foreground, and Bound Services**: Managed playback using Android's service lifecycle to keep the player active in the background and foreground.
- **WorkManager**: Integrated for managing scheduled tasks like the sleep timer.
- **Broadcast Receivers**: Used for handling system events such as headphone plug/unplug and managing playback accordingly.

## Learning Experience

While developing **Chaos Music Player**, I gained practical knowledge of essential Android components, including:

- **Services**: Background, foreground, and bound services to manage playback.
- **WorkManager**: Used WorkManager in Chaos Music Player to schedule reliable background tasks, manage task chaining, and optimize performance under system constraints.
- **PendingIntent & Notification**: For controlling media playback outside the app (e.g., from lock screen or notifications).
- **BroadcastReceiver**: To handle external events like headphone plug/unplug and managing play/pause state.
- **MediaSessionCompat**: Integrating system-wide media controls across different Android API levels, which posed challenges due to scarce resources.
- **Room DB with Many-to-Many Relationship**: Implemented Room database to store favorite songs and playlists with a many-to-many relationship between songs and playlists.
  
Developing this app provided me with insights into how Android features work differently on various API levels and how to implement backward-compatible solutions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Equalizer**: Adding an in-built equalizer for users to tweak audio settings.
- **Themes & UI Enhancements**: Incorporating more visual themes to provide users with customization options.
- **Cloud Sync**: Enabling cloud sync for playlists and favorites across devices.
- **Widget Support**: Adding a home screen widget for easy access to playback controls.
